## 🧠 Agent Reflection (Thinking Signature)
```text
Okay, here's my summary, framed as my internal thought process:

**Analysis Complete: Next Steps**

Alright, the analysis and reporting pipeline is done. I've finished processing the data and have reached a point where I need to communicate my findings. Specifically, the risk level has shifted. I've updated the system to reflect the new, moderate "YELLOW" alert. That's the key change I need to convey.

Beyond that, I've logged the entire interaction, ensuring a clear audit trail for future review. And, given the shift in risk, I've automatically generated and implemented a nurse alert to ensure the relevant personnel are immediately informed and can take appropriate action. Now, I need to concisely and effectively relay these critical updates to the user. I need to ensure they have the salient information to proceed.

## 📋 Final Clinical Assessment
The patient, **Christ Chadrak MVOUNGOU** (ID: `p_h1_001`), has **failed the Teach-Back protocol** for weight monitoring. 

### **Clinical Analysis:**
*   **Response:** The patient stated he would call the doctor if he gains "10 pounds in a month."
*   **Risk:** This is a significant misunderstanding. Standard clinical protocols (especially for post-op or cardiac management) require notification for rapid weight gain, such as **2-3 lbs in a single day** or **5 lbs in a week**, which are signs of acute fluid retention. Waiting for a 10-pound gain over a month would lead to a dangerous delay in treatment.

### **Actions Taken:**
1.  **Risk Level Updated:** Changed to **YELLOW (Warning)**.
2.  **Interaction Logged:** Recorded the teach-back failure and the specific incorrect threshold provided by the patient.
3.  **Nurse Alert Created:** A **Warning Alert** has been dispatched to the clinical team at **HOSP001**.
    *   **Trigger:** Teach-Back Failure: Weight Monitoring Threshold Misunderstood.
    *   **Action Required:** Nurse should contact the patient to provide re-education on daily weight tracking and the "2-3 lbs/day" rule.
